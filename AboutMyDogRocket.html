<h2>NEW! Rocket Quiz.</h2>
<p>Go to the <a href="Homepage.html">Homepage</a> at the Other Materials section to play the quiz! Write down the <i><b>letter</b></i> of your answer, and then check your answers at the very bottom of this page. Make sure to complete the quiz before you look!</p>

<h2>Taking Care of Rocket</h2>
<p>There are a few things we do to take care of Rocket. Every day we take him on 2-3 walks. He takes naps and his bedtime is 9:00, just like mine! Every day, we comb and brush his fur and brush his teeth. (he tries to eat the poultry-flavored toothpaste!) Rocket is the kind of dog where sometimes he's <i>really</i> cuddly, and sometimes he's <i>really</i> feisty! We have a size 3 soccer ball that he likes to use! It is usable, but he chewed it up! We love to kick it around with him! He has a water bowl and a food bowl where he eats and drinks. He has a crate with a cozy dog bed for when he takes naps or goes to sleep. We even have a little crate cover, which is a piece of cloth that wraps around the outside of his crate. It makes it dark inside his crate. Sometimes, we have to clip his nails or give him a bath!</p>

<h2>Rocket's Cool Skills</h2>
<p>Rocket has many amazing skills! For example, the first time he tried swimming, he was practically an Olympic athlete! He is a <i>very</i> smart dog and since he is relatively new (we got him in early December) we are still in the middle of training. He is pretty good at sitting on command. He also is by far the fastest runner in our family!If this counts, another amazing skill is the fact that he is the most adorable thing in the universe!</p>

<h2>Rocket's Look</h2>
<p>Rocket is a special color of Cavalier King Charles Spaniel called ruby. It is actually brown with a reddish hue, not red. He has white marks on his entire belly and chin, and he has a little white stripe on his forehead. He is a small dog. He has brown eyes. He has a long tongue and he is ridiculously fast for his size. At his speediest, he is <i>ten times faster</i> than my dad! </p>

<h2>Rocket's Behavior</h2>
<p>Rocket <i>loves</i> hanging out with ANY human! Other dogs? Not so much! His behavior is perfect for our family because he is very versatile and will cuddle and be quiet <i>and</i> go for long walks and exercise. He is a wonderful traveler and can go on medium sized car rides. 

<h2>What Rooms is Rocket Allowed to Go In?</h2>
<p>We have multiple baby gates around our house to block Rocket from some rooms. At the time of writing, Rocket is allowed to go in the kitchen/dining room where his crate, food, water, and toys usually are. When he has to go to the bathroom, he rings some bells on the door and goes outside. He can also do this if he just wants to play outside. Sometimes, we take down the baby gate that blocks him into the living room for a couple hours at a time.</p>

<h2>Rocket's Achievements</h2>
<p>1. Potty trained in a single day.</p>
<p>2. Amazing swimmer on first try</p>
<p>3. SUPER fast runner!</p>
<p>4. A great traveler</p>

<h2>Rocket's Name</h2>
<p>Rocket's full name is Rocket Fizz Van Heest. He is named after a candy shop with crazy candies, like ant lollipops. We call him Rocket for short. We have many, many nicknames for him. A few of them are Rufus, Rocky, and Fizzy</p>

<h2>Silly Puppy Stories</h2>
<p>One night, me and my dad opened the baby gate so that Rocket could come into my room. Strangely, he didn't come. We just sat around for a while. Then, we heard a sniff. Rocket had been in my room the whole time, we just didn't see him!</p>
<p>When Rocket starts to chew something he isn't supposed to, like a shoe, we usually find a way for him to give up the item. But, the whole time, Rocket makes this I'm-guilty! face that is always hilarious!</p>

<h2>Learn About Cavalier King Charles Spaniels</h2>
<p>Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are adorable puppies that were originally bred in England. There are three color types for Cavaliers. The two most common color types are Blenheim and Tricolor. Blenheim puppies are mostly white with ruby-colored (see Rocket's Look) patches. Tricolor puppies are a mix of ruby, brown, and white. The third type is Ruby. Ruby puppies are a little less common then Blenheim and Tricolor puppies, but they aren't rare. See Rocket's Look for more info on Ruby puppies.</p>

<h2>Rocket's Two Weaknesses</h2>
<p>Rocket's first weakness is the fact that he can't handle being alone. If somebody isn't even in the <i>room</i> with him, he will bark. When we all go somewhere without him, it gets even worse! He goes <i>crazy!</i></p>
<p>Rocket's other weakness is that he absolutely loves other people, but does not like other dogs! He hates when the other, bigger dogs sniff him at the dog park and try to play with him! He is a very small dog, though!</p>

<h2>Toys</h2>
<p>Rocket loves his toys! We like to occasionally go to Chow Hound or Pet Smart to get him a toy! Some of his favorites are an orange plastic hedgehog, a small green plastic hippo, and a dark gray plastic mouse!</p>

<h2>Dog Daycare</h2>
<p>The two dog care places we are trying out for Rocket are Happy Tails Pet Boarding and My Best Friends Inn. Rocket does not enjoy being away from us and with other dogs, but sometimes we have to do it!</p>

<h2>Rocket's Favorite Foods</h2>
<p>We are trying out different foods for Rocket every couple of months. My sister Rosa loves to give him tiny crumbles of hamburger meat in his food dish, and Rocket loves it! Rocket is sad that all she is allowed to give him is about a teaspoon! Dogs cannot have chocolate, onions, tomatoes, and a few other foods.</p>

<h2>Rocket's Favorite Things to do Outside</h2>
<p>Rocket loves playing with a soccer ball outside! He even scores some goals. He also loves it when we bring all his toys outside and we play tug of war and fetch.</p>

<h2>Rocket's Soccer Score</h2>
<p>Rocket is an amazing player! He loves playing soccer . . . and destroying balls! We have a designated soccer ball for him (it is the one that is hardly usable it is so destroyed!) that we use when we are playing with him. He is an excellent player both on offense and defense. We think he is a midfielder that is a great goalie, too!</p>

<h2>Rocket Q&A</h2>
<p><b><i>What are the dog parks Rocket goes to?</i></b></p>
<p>Rocket likes going to the Prairie View dog park, and sometimes the Fairview dog park. Both are in Southwest Michigan.</p> 
<p><b><i>Does Rocket take a lot of naps?</i></b></p>
<p>Yes, he takes quite a few naps. He probably sleeps for about four hours per day, not counting nighttime. Also, when we go on car rides, he almost always take a big nap for the entire time!</p>
<p><b><i>Is Rocket purebred?</i></b></p>
<p>Yes, Rocket is 100% Cavalier King Charles Spaniel!</p>
