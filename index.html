<h3>Walks with Rocket</h3>
<p>Rocket loves his walks! Every day, we take him on 2-3 walks. On his walks, he loves finding something to chew! Sticks and pinecones are his favorites! Sometimes, we try to find something for him because it helps him not to chew his leash. We walk him in many places. We usually walk him in our neighborhood, but occasionally we go to hiking trails like Asylum Lake Trail. We sometimes walk him to Arcadia Elementary School and back and we play on the swings at the playground there. Other times, we walk to a house with a Little Free Library ( a small, house-shaped thing that can hold books) and they put Milk-Bones in there! We give him one-third of a Milk-Bone because he is a small dog. Sometimes we walk him to Linden Grove Middle School and back. That route has a lot of hills! We still have yet to train him to walk loosely on the leash: he tugs and tugs and always has to be in front of us! It's like he's walking <i>us</i> instead of <i>us</i> walking <i>him!</i> Rocket has a red leash with white pictures of bones on it. We also have a higher quality backup leash in case he chews through the current one. He is a strong chewer! Me and my sister usually join one or sometimes two of the walks per day.Rocket loves when people we see on the walk stop to pet him!</p>
<h3>Rocket's Space</h3>
<p>In the house, Rocket has his own space in the dining room/kitchen. It has his crate, food/water bowls, and toys. Rocket's crate has a dog bed in it. At night, he sleeps in the dog bed in his crate, and for most of the day, Rocket keeps his dog bed in his crate. Sometimes, Rocket pulls his dog bed out of his crate all by himself and onto the kitchen floor. He lays on his dog bed! We also have a crate cover for him. A crate cover is a piece of fabric that covers his crate. It wraps all around his crate, and it makes it dark in his crate when it is nighttime when he is sleeping or taking a nap. Dogs like this because dogs are descendants of wolves. Wolves live in dens, which are dark. The wolves thought this felt safe, so Rocket thinks it is a lot cozier and feels a lot safer when we put the crate cover on. His crate cover is gray with a white pattern. His dog bed is gray. Rocket eats dry dog food. Dry dog food is better for dogs teeth. We feed Rocket two times a day, but soon it will be only one time a day. Water is available for Rocket 24/7. When we are at home, he drinks from his water bowl, made of stainless steel. Rocket also has a plastic "doggy water bottle". We bring it on car rides. A small tray unfolds onto the ground. It has sides so the water does not spill out. We squeeze the water bottle, and he drinks from the tray! Rocket also has many toys including some to play tug of war and some to play fetch.</p>
<h3>Why do dogs stick their heads out of windows?(Mini-Article)</h3>
<p>Rocket is too small to stick his head out the window (he has to go in a carrier), but here is why other dogs do it!</p>
<p>Dogs get hot easily in cars, When they get overheated, or even worried about getting overheated, they get stressed. They want some fresh air to relieve their stress. They stick their head out the window, and it works! They aren't as stressed, and it is really cute!</p>
<h3>Rocket At the Dog Park</h3>
<p>Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are very small dogs. Also, puppies are smaller than dogs. Rocket is a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel <i>puppy.</i> Rocket gets scared at the dog park. He really likes it when the other dog owners pet him, but not when the other bigger dogs sniff him. We like to go to a few dog parks to get Rocket used to a few of them. We like to go to Fairview dog park and Prairie View dog park. There is also a good dog park at a park in Portage. We sometimes bring one of Rocket's toys to the dog park to remind him of how much fun he has playing at home and so that he has something to do. We sometimes start the dog park trip by going in the small dog area. There are usually no dogs there, so he can play alone and realize the dog park is a good place. He will reluctantly run with us and gently play with toys. After a little bit of time, we move into the all-dogs area. He is very scared, but we think with a little time, he will at least be able to play by himself without being scared in the all-dogs area!</p>
<h3>Naptime for Rocket (Mini-Article)</h3>
<p>Rocket takes many naps every day. At the time of writing, Rocket takes one morning nap and one afternoon nap. They are each two hours long. His morning nap is from 9AM to 11AM, and his afternoon nap is from 1PM to 3PM. He sleeps at nighttime.</p>
<h3>In the Car with Rocket</h3>
<p>Rocket does well in the car! He can ride in the car just fine for up to a few hours at a time! He has gone on a hilly 3 hour trip to Ohio. We have a blue carrier for him that he loves! One morning, he just spent a half hour of his time sitting in the carrier. We weren't even in the car! Rocket either rides in the middle of me and my sister in the backseat or up in the front with Mom. If Dad is in the car, Rocket always goes in the backseat. We bring his dog water bottle (see Rocket's Space article) on car trips. He is not big enough to ride without a carrier like most Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. We often take small breaks while we are driving though, to make sure we don't stress him out too much. He enjoys riding in the car with us!</p>
<h3>Thinking about getting a dog?</h3>
<p>Having a dog is a lot of work and a lot of fun! If you want to get a dog, here are a few things to think about.</p>
<p>First,think about where you would want and wouldn't want a dog to go in your house. For example, you might want a dog to hang out in your bedroom and the kitchen/dining room, but not in the living room. Also, some people might be allergic to dogs. If this is true, that is okay, because there are some hypoallergenic breeds, like goldendoodles. (mix of golden retriever and poodle) You will need to pick out whether you want a shelter dog or a purebred dog from a breeder. Purebred dogs tend to cost more, but are easier to train. Shelter dogs are cheaper, but they are usually mixed breeds and are harder to train. They also are usually around five years old. But if you buy a shelter dog, you will be immensely helping the dog population because there are too many dogs for homes around the world. You will need to also buy supplies for your dog. You will need food and water bowls, a crate, a dog bed, dog combs, toothbrushes, and hairbrushes to keeps your dog's fur under control. You will also need a carrier if you have a small dog, dog food, dog treats, toys and more. If your family decides to get a dog, you will need to pick a good time to get a dog. Some good times to get one are during school breaks, where everyone is available to help the dog. If you want to get a shelter dog, a good place to get one is the SPCA. If you are getting a purebred dog, first you will have to choose the breed you want. One of my friends wants a German Shepherd for example. Here are steps to getting a dog. Step One: Does anybody in your family want a dog?</p>

<p>Labrador Retrievers are large, gentle dogs that have a great temperament and come in many colors including brown, black, cream, and yellow.
